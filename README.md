# Ciic4030-Project
PL Project based around creating a python like programming language that implements logic functionalities.
The following is a log of progress on the language, starting at earliest development.

11/28/2021:
Currently the code will take an input and using a lexer and a parser creates intermediary code based around mathematical equations and with PEMDAS in mind.
The code in its current state will not run any code as it has no iterpreter. That is the following process. 

11/29/2021:
Code now has working interpreter and can process variables, code works as follows:
> VAR a = 5
-> 5
> a
-> 5
> a ^ 2
-> 25 
> VAR a = a * 2
-> 10
> a 
-> 10

Next Readme update will catalogue adding logical operators to the language.
